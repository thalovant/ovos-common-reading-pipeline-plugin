An OVOS pipeline plugin that orchestrates "read me something" across
*provider* skills - broadcasting a search, picking the best answer, and
reading it aloud with bookmark/"continue" support, all from one
dedicated stage in ovos-core's intent pipeline.

Provider skills implement the ovos.common_reading.* bus protocol - see
README.md for the full spec.

Utterance matching uses padacioso (pure Python, no native dependencies),
trained at runtime from the *.intent files bundled per language in
locale/<lang>/.

How a request is handled, and why it is split the way it is:

- match() only classifies the utterance and decides whether to claim it.
  ovos-core (3.7+) gives every plugin's match() 10 seconds on a small
  worker pool and skips a session whose previous call is still running;
  anything slow in there makes the utterance fall through to later
  stages while this plugin carries on regardless.
- ovos-core then dispatches "<skill_id>:<intent>" to the handler
  registered for it in __init__. The handler does the quick part: the
  provider search, the "is it that one?" question when the best match is
  unsure, and the announcement. It returns as soon as the story starts,
  which is what ends the turn (mycroft.skill.handler.complete ->
  ovos.utterance.handled), so "stop" and "pause" reach this plugin while
  the story is being read.
- The story itself is read on a daemon thread, one sentence at a time.

Everything a story needs is kept per session (the session id in the
message context), because on a HiveMind hub one instance of this plugin
serves every connected user: one user's "stop" or "continue" must not
touch another user's story.

#   becomes a pause longer than the voice's own between two sentences;

#   read straight through a dash, and through a comma too: their phonemizer
#   drops both;
# - "…" becomes "...": Phoonnx ends a sentence at "..." (80-130 ms of

        global stop mechanism actually knows to call our stop() when
        the user says 'stop'.

        REAL BUG this fixes, confirmed via a live screenshot: saying
        'stop' mid-story did nothing - the story kept reading through
        several more paragraphs, eventually forcing a full ovos-core
        restart to interrupt it. The reading loop itself
        (_read_content, below) was never the problem - it correctly
        checks its stop flag between every sentence and breaks
        cleanly. The actual issue: OVOS's stop pipeline determines
        which skill(s) to call .stop() on by consulting the session's
        active_skills list, and this plugin was never being added to
        it, since this plugin (PipelinePlugin + OVOSAbstractApplication,
        not a full skill loaded via the skill manager) doesn't inherit
        from ovos_workshop.skills.converse.ConversationalSkill, which
        is normally what provides activate()/deactivate() - confirmed
        directly that OVOSAbstractApplication has no such method at
        all. So the global stop handler had no way to know this plugin
        was the thing currently speaking, and its stop() was simply
        never being invoked through the normal path.

        Since inheriting ConversationalSkill isn't an option here (no
        skill manager loads pipeline plugins the way it loads skills),
        this replicates exactly what ConversationalSkill.activate()
        itself does under the hood - emit 'intent.service.skills.
        activate' with our own skill_id - rather than the method
        itself, which isn't available on our base classes.

        The activation is forwarded from `message`, the request of the

        Real crash confirmed via a live screenshot: once _activate()

        via _handle_stop_ack() -> can_stop() as part of the normal
        stop-ack flow every active skill goes through - and since this
        override didn't exist yet, that raised NotImplementedError
        every single time, logged as a real (if apparently non-fatal
        to the overall stop still working) error on every stop/pause.

        ("<skill_id>.stop") and for a global one ("mycroft.stop"), with the
        session the stop came from; stop() only runs when this returns False.

        The stop flag is set BEFORE the confirmation is spoken - a real,
        confirmed race condition, found via live testing: the reading loop
        (on its own thread, blocked inside speak(sentence, wait=...) for
        whatever sentence is currently playing) and this method (called from
        a separate bus-event thread) both want to enqueue TTS around the same
        moment. With the flag set AFTER 'stop_reading' was spoken, there's a
        window where the reading loop's thread wakes up (its own current
        sentence finishes), sees it may go on, and queues ONE MORE sentence
        before this method gets a chance to set the flag - which is exactly
        the "still reads one sentence after 'stop'" behavior reported.

        Waiting on the dialog itself is still not optional: without it,
        speak_dialog() only enqueues the TTS request and returns
        immediately. 'stop' is very likely to also trigger OVOS core's own
        audio-stop handling in the same moment, which flushes the TTS queue -
        a just-enqueued, not-yet-started confirmation gets silently wiped out
        by that flush. The wait blocks until the dialog has actually
        finished being spoken (or for as long as it takes to say, see
        _speak_dialog_and_wait), so nothing can race it away.
