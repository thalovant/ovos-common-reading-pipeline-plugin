"""Rebuild ReadContent.intent, ReadContentByCollection.intent,
ReadContentByType.intent, and continue.intent for all languages,
avoiding padacioso's unreliable '(word| )' empty-alternative syntax
(confirmed to silently fail to match when the optional word is
omitted) - every optional word (including "me", articles, connectors)
is instead written out as full separate alternative lines. Also adds
natural 'about'/'sobre'/'über' connector-word phrasings, and broadens
content-type vocabulary (story/tale/fairy tale/article/news/document/
report/horoscope/almanac) - this is a general reading pipeline now,
not just a storyteller.

Real gaps found via user testing that this addresses:
- "Tell me about {title}" (a bare catch-all, no content-type word
  required) collided with other skills' own "tell me about X" phrasing
  (e.g. a Wikipedia/biography skill) - "tell me about abraham lincoln"
  could get mis-routed here instead of to a knowledge-lookup skill.
  Removed entirely; every "Tell" pattern now requires an actual
  content-type word, which "Read" doesn't need to (see below).
- "Tell me the story about the little mermaid" didn't match anything -
  every previous pattern connected the content word directly to
  {title} with no "about"/connector option for the bare "the X"
  forms. Added throughout.
- No way to ask for "my horoscope" or "today's horoscope" without a
  {title} at all - every previous pattern required one. New
  ReadContentByType.intent (en-us, da-dk) covers phrasing like "read
  me my horoscope" / "what is my horoscope" / "read the horoscope",
  with content_type forwarded to provider skills as a search hint (see
  __init__.py's ovos.common_reading.search "content_type" field) so
  e.g. a horoscope-only provider can filter/respond appropriately.
- "me" isn't always present ("tell the story cinderella" is as valid
  as "tell me the story cinderella") - both forms are now generated
  for every pattern, not just the with-"me" one.

Note on grammatical gender: German/Spanish/French/Italian/Portuguese
decline their indefinite article by noun gender ('eine Geschichte' but
'ein Artikel'/'einen Bericht'; 'un cuento' but 'una noticia'). Rather
than factor out a shared article (which would produce wrong pairings),
each full 'article+noun' combination is written out as its own
alternation branch. English's 'a'/'an' is handled the same way for the
same reason - simpler here, but still safest to just enumerate rather
than assume a single shared article works with every noun. Danish
neuter/common gender ('et eventyr' but 'en historie') is handled the
same way in ReadContentByType by avoiding a shared possessive
('min'/'mit') across an open {content_type} wildcard entirely - see
that section's own comment.

Only en-us and da-dk got the full new-vocabulary treatment (fairy
tale/horoscope/almanac, ReadContentByType) in this pass - the other 6
languages only got the two SAFE fixes (removing the collision-prone
bare "about" line, adding the "story about {title}" connector variant
using words already validated elsewhere in this same script) since
getting horoscope/almanac/fairy-tale grammar right in 6 more languages
without a native speaker to check needs more care than a good-faith
guess deserves. Tracked as a follow-up, not silently skipped."""

#
# content_type stays a genuinely open, generic wildcard - deliberately
# NOT special-cased per content word (no dedicated "horoscope intent",
# "almanac intent", etc). This pipeline doesn't know or care what
# content types exist, the same way OCP doesn't distinguish jazz from
# disco as a "media type" - it just captures whatever word the user
# said and forwards it as a hint on the search broadcast (see
# COMMON_READING_SEARCH's "content_type" field), letting PROVIDER
# skills decide what they support. Confirmed via live testing this
# works cleanly for horoscope/almanac/weather report/recipe/etc, no
# collisions.
#
# The bare "Read/Tell me the {content_type}" form (no "my"/"today's"
# qualifier) was tried and REMOVED - not just "usually resolves the
# right way", but confirmed via CI running a different Python version
# (3.12) than local testing (3.11/3.14) to be a genuinely
# NON-DETERMINISTIC tie against read_content's "the {noun} about
# {title}" pattern whenever content_type captures one of read_content's
# OWN vocabulary words (story/tale/article/fairytale) followed by
# "about X" - local testing resolved it one way, CI resolved the exact
# same input the OPPOSITE way. A coin-flip across environments is a
# real bug, not a documentable edge case, so the bare "the X" form is
# gone entirely. "my {content_type}"/"today's {content_type}" have NO
# such overlap with read_content's templates (which never contain
# "my"/"today's" at all) and remain fully safe and generic - "read the
# horoscope" (bare, no "my") is consequently NOT supported; "read me
# my horoscope" / "what is my horoscope" / "read me today's horoscope"
# are.
#
# Danish additionally avoids a shared "min"/"mit" possessive across the
# open {content_type} wildcard (grammatical gender - "mit horoskop" but
# "min historie" would be wrong the other way round) by using "dagens"
# (today's - gender-invariant) for the wildcard-based lines, and

# "Tell me a story" and nothing more - no title, no collection, no
# "my"/"today's". The plugin sends the search with phrase=None and
# content_type "story", and each story provider offers one story of its own
# choosing (see README's search section). Its own intent rather than a
# ReadContentByType line: a "{content_type}" wildcard after "a" would also
# swallow "a story about cinderella" and "a story from grimm", where
# read_content and read_by_collection must win.
#
# The nouns are story words only ("story", "tale", "fairy tale", and each
# language's own), never article/news/document, so "read the news" or
# "read me an article" is never taken for "any story". Every line is fully
# literal (no wildcard), so padacioso scores an exact hit 1.0, above the
# 0.96 of "tell me a {collection} story" for "tell me a fairy tale".
#
# French, Portuguese: the hyphenated imperative ("Raconte-moi", "Conta-me")
# comes out of some STT engines without the hyphen, and padacioso matches
# them as different words, so both spellings are listed. "-nous"/"uns"/"ons"
# forms because a story is often asked for on behalf of children.

# KNOWN LIMITATION (pre-existing, not introduced by the above additions
# - confirmed via live testing): combining BOTH a title AND a collection
# in one utterance ("tell me the story about the little mermaid from
# andersen") is fragile - padacioso ties read_content's plain "the
# story {title}" pattern against read_by_collection's more specific
# "the story {title} from {collection}" one, and the LESS specific
# pattern (read_content, swallowing "from andersen" into the title
# itself) wins more often than not. The BARE "from {collection}" form
# without an explicit title works reliably ("tell me a story from
# grimm", "find {title} from {collection}") - it's specifically the
# combination of both in one utterance that's unreliable. Tracked as a
# follow-up issue rather than silently left undocumented; padacioso
# doesn't appear to consistently prefer the more specific of two tied
# wildcard patterns, so this may need a structurally different
# approach, not just word reordering, to actually fix.
READ_BY_COLLECTION = {
    # Four lines, same combinatorial-alternation approach as
    # READ_CONTENT above:
    # 1. Indefinite noun + from/by {collection} - "tell me a story
    #    from grimm", "could you read a guide by {collection}".
    # 2. Definite "the {noun} {title}" + from/by {collection} - the
    #    title+collection combination already documented (see the
    #    KNOWN LIMITATION note above) as fragile against read_content's
    #    own plain "the {noun} {title}" pattern - kept as before
    #    (pre-existing behavior, not made worse or better by this
    #    pass), not re-litigated here.
    # 3. "a {collection} {noun}" (no "from"/"by" at all, provider name
    #    used adjective-style) - generalized to the FULL noun list and
    #    both with/without "me", fixing a real, confirmed gap: "read a
    #    andersen story" (no "me") previously had no matching line at
    #    all, only "read ME a {collection} story" did, and only for
    #    the single word "story", not the full noun list.
    # 4. "Find {title} by/from {collection}" - unchanged, already
    #    working correctly, no reason to touch it.
    # 5. "latest"/"newest"/"most recent" {noun} from/by {collection} -
    #    "read latest post from ovosblog", "read newest posts from
    #    ovosblog". Deliberately does NOT include "the latest"/"the
    #    newest" here (unlike QUALIFIER_CONTENT, used in READ_CONTENT
    #    above) - confirmed directly via testing: "the latest post
    #    from ovosblog" ties against READ_CONTENT's own bare "the
    #    {title}" line (both start with "the " + open text), and
    #    padacioso doesn't reliably resolve that tie toward the more
    #    specific collection match - the SAME class of issue as the
    #    title+collection fragility below. Dropping "the" from this
    #    side avoids the tie entirely: "the latest post from ovosblog"
    #    falls through to read_content instead (imperfect, but
    #    unambiguous), while "latest post from ovosblog" (no "the")
    #    reaches read_by_collection cleanly.
    #
    #    A combined title+"latest"+collection line ("read the latest
    #    post about AI from ovosblog") was also tried and NOT kept -
    #    confirmed via direct testing that it inherits the exact same
    #    pre-existing title+collection fragility documented in the
    #    KNOWN LIMITATION note above, just with "latest" layered on
    #    top rather than being a new problem. Same tradeoff as
    #    everything else there: collection-only and title-only both
    #    work reliably, the combination of all three doesn't yet.
    #
    #    NOTE - grammar only, not full behavior yet: this pipeline
    #    doesn't currently forward "latest" as a distinct signal to
    #    provider skills at all (see __init__.py's search broadcast) -
    #    a provider receiving this request today can't distinguish it
    #    from an ordinary collection-only request (no title given), so
    #    it likely still returns whatever its own no-title fallback
    #    already returns (e.g. a random pick, not necessarily its most
    #    recent item) rather than actually honoring "latest"
    #    specifically. Recognizing the phrase correctly is done; making
    #    providers actually act on it is a separate, not yet
    #    implemented follow-up.
